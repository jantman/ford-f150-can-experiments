# Ford F150 Gen14 CAN bus Interface

Interface for doing various things in response to messages on the CAN bus of my 2025 (Generation 14) Ford F150, along with details of construction, initial investigation/experiments, wiring info, etc.

## What does it do?

* Trigger a relay for OEM-style aftermarket bed lights, when the CHMSL bed lights are on.
* Allow the truck bed toolbox to be unlocked via two buttons, only when the doors are unlocked and the vehicle is in park.
* ... whatever else I think of in the future? (there's substantial room for expansion built-in)

## Contents - What's Here?

* [experiments/](experiments/) - Initial investigation and experiments with the CAN bus as well as vehicle-specific wiring and connector information.
* [f150_wiring_notes.md](f150_wiring_notes.md) - Information for my 2025 F150 Lariat V8 on what circuits are in what connectors, etc.
